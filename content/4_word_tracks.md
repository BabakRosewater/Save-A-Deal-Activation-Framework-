>  
> You mentioned that towing your camper and staying within a certain monthly budget are most important. I’m going to:  
> - Pull the exact towing specs for the Tucson you liked, and  
> - Put together a couple of payment options that fit the range we discussed.  
>  
> I’ll send that to you **by 12:00 p.m. tomorrow**. Does that timing work for you?”

## 4. Next-Day Promise Fulfillment Text

**After Sending the Email with Info**

> “John, as promised, I just sent you an email with the towing details and a couple of payment options we discussed. Please take a look when you have a moment, and I’ll give you a call later today to get your thoughts. – [Your Name]”

## 5. Phone Call Opener (Next Day)

> “Hi John, it’s [Your Name] at Clark Hyundai.  
>  
> I just wanted to follow up on the email I sent you earlier with the towing details and the two payment options.  
>  
> Did you have a chance to take a quick look at that yet?”

If **yes**:

> “Great. What stood out to you? Was there one of those options that felt closer to what you had in mind?”

If **no**:

> “No worries at all. When you do get a moment to review it, would it be helpful if I walked you through the differences between the two options, or would you rather look them over first and then we reconnect?”
