# Save-A-Deal Activation Playbook

> If it’s not activated before the guest leaves, it’s not really a Save-A-Deal tomorrow. It’s just chasing.

## Step 1 — In-Store Promise Before the Guest Leaves

**Objective:**  
Turn “I’ll follow up” into a **clear, concrete promise** tied to the guest’s motivator.

### What Good Looks Like

- We know **why** they are in the market (motivator).
- We know what question(s) they still need answered.
- We make a promise:
  - **What** we’ll send or do.
  - **When** we’ll send it (exact time).
- We confirm the best **email** and **mobile number**.

See detailed word tracks in `content/4_word_tracks.md`.

## Step 2 — Taillight Text (Gratitude Only)

**Objective:**  
Show appreciation and reinforce the relationship, without pressure.

### Principles

- Short, simple, human.
- No payment talk, no “please call me,” no pushing.
- Optional: gentle reminder of the promise.

This text sets us apart and satisfies one of the top things customers say they want in post-visit surveys:  
> “I would like to have been thanked and appreciated for my business and my time.”

Templates are in `templates/text_taillight_followup.md`.

## Step 3 — Same-Day Email: Gratitude + Recap + Links + Promise

**Objective:**  
Anchor the relationship, recap the conversation, and set clear expectations for tomorrow.

### Components

- Warm greeting + genuine gratitude.
- Recap of:
  - Vehicles they looked at.
  - What matters most to them (motivators).
- Helpful links:
  - Vehicle detail pages.
  - Credit app.
  - Trade appraisal form.
- Restate the **promise**:
  - What we will send.
  - When we will send it.
- Reassurance that there is no pressure; we are a resource.

## Step 4 — CRM Notes: Salesperson + Manager

**Objective:**  
Capture everything needed to make Save-A-Deal meetings productive.

We require **two sets of notes**:

1. **Salesperson CRM Notes**
2. **Sales Manager CRM Notes**

Salesperson notes: motivator, vehicles, numbers, objections, promise, timeline.  
Manager notes: manager intro, read on the deal, commitments, and next-day strategy.

Standards and templates are in:

- `templates/crm_salesperson_note_template.md`
- `templates/crm_manager_note_template.md`
- Detailed guidance: `content/5_crm_guidelines.md`

## Step 5 — Next-Day Promise Fulfillment + Text Ping

**Objective:**  
Demonstrate reliability and re-open a natural conversation.

### Sequence

1. Send the **promised information** by the agreed time:
   - Towing specs, history report, comparisons, payment options, etc.
2. Immediately send a **short text**:
   - Let them know the email is sent.
   - Remind them what’s inside.
   - Set expectation for a follow-up call.

Templates are in:

- `templates/email_promise_fulfillment.md`
- `templates/text_next_day_ping.md`

## How This Feeds Save-A-Deal Meetings

When these steps are followed:

- Save-A-Deal meetings the next day have:
  - Clear motivators.
  - Documented objections.
  - A defined promise that we can now fulfill.
  - A natural reason to call.

The **meeting format** and coaching structure live in  
`training/save_a_deal_meeting_format.md` and `training/roleplay_scenarios.md`.
