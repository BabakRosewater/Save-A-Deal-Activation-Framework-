# Save-A-Deal Activation Framework — Overview

## Why This Exists

Most “follow-up” is weak because it starts too late.

A guest leaves the dealership with no clear promise from us, and the next day we chase them with generic “just checking in” calls and emails. It feels like pressure to them and guesswork to us.

The **Save-A-Deal Activation Framework** fixes this by:

- Activating follow-up **before** the guest leaves.
- Making a **specific promise** tied to the guest’s motivator.
- Showing **gratitude** immediately after their visit.
- Capturing high-quality **CRM notes** from both salesperson and manager.
- Fulfilling our promise the next day and reopening the conversation with confidence.

## Core Principle

> **Follow-up happens before the customer leaves.**

When we do this well:

- Guests expect to hear from us.
- Our outreach is about **fulfilling a promise**, not pushing a sale.
- Save-A-Deal meetings are focused, specific, and productive.

## The Five Steps

1. **In-Store Promise**  
   Before the guest leaves, the salesperson makes a specific commitment tied to what matters most to the guest.

2. **Taillight Text (Gratitude Only)**  
   Shortly after they leave, the salesperson sends a short, human text saying thank you (no selling).

3. **Same-Day Email**  
   Email that expresses gratitude, recaps the visit, includes helpful links, and clearly restates the promise and timeline.

4. **CRM Notes (Salesperson + Manager)**  
   High-quality notes documenting motivators, numbers, objections, promises, and next steps.

5. **Next-Day Promise Fulfillment + Text Ping**  
   Deliver the promised information by the agreed time, then text to confirm the email and set up the follow-up call.

Each of these steps is broken down in detail in `content/2_playbook.md` and supported by templates in the `templates/` folder.
