Hi [First Name],

Thank you again for spending time with me today at [Dealership Name]. I really appreciated the opportunity to get to know you and to learn more about what you need in your next vehicle.

As a quick recap, you spent time with the [Vehicle(s) – Year/Make/Model/Trim], and you shared that:

- [Motivator #1 – e.g., you want something comfortable for daily driving]  
- [Motivator #2 – e.g., towing your camper is important]  
- [Motivator #3 – e.g., staying within a certain monthly budget matters]

Here are a few links you may find useful:

As promised, I’m going to put together:

- [Item #2 – e.g., a couple of payment options that fit the budget we discussed]

I will email that information to you **by [time tomorrow]**.

In the meantime, if any new questions come up, you can call or text me directly at [Salesperson Phone Number].
