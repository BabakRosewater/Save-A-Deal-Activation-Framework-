# CRM Template — Manager Notes

For every unsold guest where the manager was introduced.

---

**MGR INTRO**  
When and how did you meet them? What did you reinforce?

- [e.g., Met guest and spouse at desk after test drive. Reinforced transparency, no-pressure process, and our commitment to finding the right fit.]

---

**MGR READ**  
Motivator, urgency, decision-makers, and deal temperature.

- **Motivator:** [e.g., Family vehicle + towing camper.]  
- **Urgency:** [e.g., Wants vehicle in next 1–2 weeks.]  
- **Decision-makers:** [e.g., Both spouses share decision; spouse has final say.]  
- **Temperature:** [Hot / Warm / Cool – pick one and explain.]

---

**MGR COMMITMENTS**  
What did you personally promise?

- [e.g., Committed to review structure and see if we can present one option closer to their target payment.]

---

**NEXT-DAY STRATEGY**  
Guidance for salesperson and Save-A-Deal meeting.

- [e.g., Lead with promised towing specs + two payment options. Anchor on comfort + towing + staying in budget. Invite them back for second look this weekend. Consider offering alternate trim or term if needed.]
