# Save-A-Deal Activation Framework

> **Core Principle:** Follow-up happens *before* the customer leaves the dealership.

This repository documents the **Save-A-Deal Activation Framework** – a practical, behavior-based system that makes it easier for sales teams and managers to re-engage unsold guests and turn “not today” into “yes, we’re ready now.”

The framework is built around one idea:

> If a guest leaves without buying, the deal is not dead.  
> But our ability to save the deal tomorrow depends on what we did **before** their taillights left the curb.
