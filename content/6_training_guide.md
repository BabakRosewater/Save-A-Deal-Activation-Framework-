## Training Objectives

By the end of training, salespeople and managers should be able to:

1. Explain the principle that **follow-up starts before the guest leaves**.
2. Execute each step of the Save-A-Deal Activation Framework.
3. Use the approved word tracks and templates.
4. Enter CRM notes that support strong Save-A-Deal meetings.
5. Role-play common scenarios with confidence.

## Suggested Training Flow (60–90 minutes)

1. **Opening (5–10 min)**  
   - Explain the problem: weak, late, generic follow-up.  
   - Introduce the framework and the five steps.

2. **Concept Walkthrough (20–30 min)**  
   - Use `content/2_playbook.md` to walk through each step.  
   - Highlight key behaviors and where deals are usually lost.

3. **Word Track Practice (15–20 min)**  
   - Use `content/4_word_tracks.md`.  
   - Have salespeople practice:
     - In-store promise.
     - Taillight text.
     - Next-day follow-up call opener.

4. **CRM Notes Workshop (10–15 min)**  
   - Show real (anonymized) examples of weak vs. strong notes.  
   - Use the templates in `templates/crm_salesperson_note_template.md` and  
     `templates/crm_manager_note_template.md`.

5. **Roleplay Scenarios (10–20 min)**  
   - Use `training/roleplay_scenarios.md`.  
   - Rotate salespeople, managers, and trainers through the roles.

6. **Save-A-Deal Meeting Alignment (10–15 min)**  
   - Review `training/save_a_deal_meeting_format.md`.  
   - Clarify expectations for what must be in CRM before Save-A-Deal meetings.

## Reinforcement Ideas

- Post the **checklist** (`content/3_checklist.md`) at the sales tower.  
- Incorporate the framework into daily **Save-A-Deal meetings**.  
- Use role-play at least **once per week** for the first 30 days.  
- Have managers spot-check CRM notes for every unsold guest and coach to the standard.
