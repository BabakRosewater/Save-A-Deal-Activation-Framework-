## Coaching Focus

- Are we **making specific promises** tied to motivators?
- Are taillight texts and same-day emails happening **every time**?
- Are CRM notes **clear enough** that any manager could pick up the deal?
- Are we holding ourselves accountable to **fulfilling promises on time**?

This meeting turns Save-A-Deal from a vague conversation (“who can we call?”) into a disciplined daily practice driven by the Save-A-Deal Activation Framework.
